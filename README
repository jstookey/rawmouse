------------------ CHANGELOG ---------------------
2004-04-22 - added the ability to detect whether RawMouse is available or not so the application can 
   either use a different multi-mouse system, or exit gracefully (thanks to Mark Healey).
2005-04-24 - Modified the code work with the latest version of MinGW.  The new MinGW incorporates
   rawinput, so my winuser header and library is obsolete.
2006-03-05 - Initialized is_absolute and is_virtual_desktop to work better with newer versions of VStudio.
2012-11-22 - Moved source files to Github

------------------  COMPILING WITH GCC ------------------------------

This program was compiled using MinGW/GCC

In order to recreate the compile environment:

  1) Install and configure MinGW from http://www.mingw.org (tested with mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe).
  2) The files that are required are raw_mouse.c, raw_mouse.h, and raw_mouse_test.c
  3) From the command line, run "gcc raw_mouse.c raw_mouse_test.c"

-------------------  COMPILING WITH MS VISUAL C++ --------------------

This example can also be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ version 6, but first you need to download
        and install the Microsoft Platform SDK.  In order to access the Microsoft Platform SDK from VStudio, 
	I had to go to tools->options->directories and add the SDK's bin, include, lib, and src folders.
	In the same window, I had drag each of the SDK's folders to the top of the respective list
	to give those folders priority over the others.

	To create your project for Visual Studio (after you prepare VStudio to work with the MS
	     Platform SDK), do the following:

	1) Open Visual C++ and start a new Win32 Application as a "blank project"
	   (This is necessary because if you simply open the .c file in VStudio
	   VStudio will assume it's a "console application" and it won't compile properly.)
	2) The files that are required are raw_mouse.c, raw_mouse.h, and raw_mouse_test.c
	3) Copy all .c and .h files into the new project's root folder
	4) In the left pane, click "File View" and left click "Source Files" and select
	     "add files to folder" from the popup menu, and add your file.
	5) You're all set!  Press f5 to build the program.
